Conditional Rendering:
Conditional rendering is used whenever you want to show, hide, or change 
elements on the screen based on a specific situation (state).
ways: 1. ternary Operator

      2.The "This OR That" Logic (Login/Logout):
      {isLoggedIn ? <UserDashboard /> : <LoginForm />}

      3.The "Short Circuit" Logic (The && Operator):

      {isFinished && <span>✅ Completed</span>}
      Logic: If isFinished is true, React continues and renders the span. If false, it stops immediately.


Side Effect:
effect which interacts b/w react component and outside the component.
ex: data fetching,setting up subscriptions,setting timers,manually accessing in DOM.
->where to place these side effects:-1. inside Event Handlers(other than render Logic)->triggered by events(onClick,onSubmit,etc..)
                                     2. useEffect->triggered by Rendering

useEffect:Allows us to write code that will run at different moments :mount,
                                                                      re-render,
                                                                      unmount.
